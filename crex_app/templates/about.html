    <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <span class="highlight">Chetan</span> ‚Äî the mind behind Cricket
      Craze.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a recent graduate and an
      <strong>aspiring Python developer</strong> with a deep interest in both
      software development and the world of cricket. I created this website to
      merge two of my passions ‚Äî coding and cricket ‚Äî and offer something
      valuable to the fan community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the beginning of my tech journey, I've been motivated by the desire
      to solve real-world problems through code. My expertise lies in
      <span class="highlight">Python programming</span>, and I'm steadily
      growing my skills in
      <span class="highlight"
        >backend development, data handling, and API integration</span
      >. I'm also exploring full-stack development and currently building
      multiple projects to improve my practical skills and portfolio.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cricket Craze is not just a project ‚Äî it‚Äôs a reflection of my ambition to
      blend creativity with functionality. I believe that passion, when paired
      with purpose and persistence, leads to meaningful outcomes ‚Äî and this
      website is proof of that belief.
    </p>

    <p>
      I‚Äôm on a mission to build a <strong>successful career in tech</strong> and
      contribute to the open-source and developer community along the way. I‚Äôm
      always open to learning, collaborating, and growing with like-minded
      developers and tech enthusiasts.
